My name is Gina. I am a student at Codefellows. I am a 6 year Navy veteran with a passion for Technology. After graduating with an Associate's in Computer Science I happily leapt into the IT field and worked Helpdesk for a few years before ultimately deciding to further pursue my love for programming by attending Codefellows' coding bootcamp.
