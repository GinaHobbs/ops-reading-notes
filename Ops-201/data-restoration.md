# SolarwindsMSP: SSD Data Recovery Best Practices

SSD failures are hard to detect. Here are some of the most common indicators that an SSD is dying:

**Bad Blocks** = An SSD suffering from bad blocks exhibits a few key symptoms. Saving, reading and moving files may result in failure. Actice applications may operate slowly or crash. The user may recieve prompts to repair the file system. General performace may steadily decrease, especially whenn handling large files.

**File System Repair** = If a file system requires repair but physical defect software shows no damage it could indicate an issue with the connector port. Back up files and attempt to repair the system with an application like disk utility or fsck.

**Crashing** = If a computer crashes when booting up but seems to work normally after several reboots, the SSD is probably failing.

**Read Only Mode** = While somewhat less common, it is possible for SSD's to cease functioning except in read-only mode.If the SS operates in only read-only function then it is corrupted.

## How do you fix a failed SSD

**Format the drive and redownload the OS**

**Power Cycle the SSD**

**Idling in the Boot Menu**

**Updating Drivers**
