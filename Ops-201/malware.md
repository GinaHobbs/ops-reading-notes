# Malware Remediation Tools and Techniques

The first step in dealing with malware is to enter safe mode on your computer. This makes it easier to remove the malware since it won't be running. The next step is to delete temporary files- this frees up disk space, speeds up virus scanning and even gets rid of some malware. The next step is to run a scan with malwarebytes to remove the malware. Then the web browser should be checked to make sure it is not set to redirect you to a site that could re-infect the pc.
