# Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. Identify information and duplicate the problem - document all issues so you can understand what the total issue might be. Also be sure to ask the end user about what's happening - they are the most familiar with their computer setup and recent changes that occured before the problem started. They are also most familiar with what happens before, during and after their issue.

2. Isolate the problem - starting with the most obvious and simplest issues is often best. However, it is also impiortant to consider every possible scenario, even ones that are not obvious. 

3. Test teories until resolved - see if the ideas you have for resolution actually work, starting from obvious problems to less obvious problems. If the idea doesn't work keeo going down the list until you find something that does. If you can't find a solution then calling in the next tier above you can help to solve the problem.

4. Implement the solution - Now that you know how to resolve the problem it is important to implement the change. Once the fix is applies be sure to test the system to make sure the issue is resolved.

5. Document - now that you know what the issue is and how to resolve it, be sure to document it in the ticketing system you are using.
