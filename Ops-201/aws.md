# AWS  - Virtualization in the Cloud

Virtualization is the creation of a virtual, rather than an actual version of something. The concept goes back to the 60's, but it was popularized in 1999 when it was introduced into cheap Intel hardware. Now practically everything can be virtualized. Amazon relies heavily on virtualization for all of its cloud services.
