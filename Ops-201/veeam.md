# How to Get Started with Veeam Free Edition

Veeam is a program that can backup virtual machines. It can doo the following:

**VeeamZIP** = Creates an ad hoc backup of a running VM, which allows you to easily copy a backup to another host without having to power off the original VM. The VM created using this is compressed.

**Powerful and Flexible Restores** = Supports a number of recovery scenarios, including recovery of an entire VM, guest OS files and individual application items.

**Quick Migration** = Migrates a live VM between hosts or datastores with minimal downtime and without requiring clusters, shared storage, or even VMwarevMotion or Storage vMotion.
